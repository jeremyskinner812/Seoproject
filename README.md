## Description

My motivation for this project was to make the site more accessible and useful for someone using a screen reader. Using the starter code from my coding Bootcamp I added text to the image tags and made used semantic tags to make the site more accessible. It makes the information on the site more accessible and available to someone who is sight impaired. I learned how to better use semantic HTML tags to organize and break up a site and include descriptions of the images on the page to make it accessible to a wider audience.
